    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Modern combine harvesters collect real-time, geo-located yield data during harvesting.
      However, these yield maps often contain measurement errors due to sensor noise, positional inaccuracies, and data transmission delays.
      Cleaning this data is crucial for training accurate machine learning models for sub-field level yield prediction.
    </p>

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>
      Raw yield maps often contain systematic errors, such as:
      - GPS inaccuracies leading to positional shifts.
      - Delayed yield registration, causing mismatched spatial locations.
      - Speed fluctuations and cutting width inconsistencies, affecting reported yield values.
    </p>
    <p>
      These challenges introduce noise in machine learning models, reducing their ability to make reliable predictions at the sub-field scale.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Solution: Multi-Stage Data Cleaning Pipeline</h2>
    <p>We developed a comprehensive pipeline for outlier detection and yield data cleaning, which includes:</p>

          <h3>Statistical Outlier Detection</h3>

    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
    <p>
      Our study found that:
      - For field-level yield predictions, simple regional thresholding was sufficient.
      - For sub-field level yield predictions, advanced techniques such as IQR-based statistical filtering and Spatio-Temporal cleaning provided the best results.
      - The most computationally expensive methods, like advanced Spatio-Temporal filtering, improved prediction accuracy but were not always necessary.
